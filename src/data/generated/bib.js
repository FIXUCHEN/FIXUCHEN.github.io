        "abstract": "The problem of automatic recognition of plant diseases has been historically based on conventional machine learning techniques such as Support Vector Machines, Multilayer Perceptron Neural Networks and Decision Trees. However, the prevailing approach has shifted to the application of deep learning concepts, with focus on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). In general, this kind of technique requires large datasets containing a wide variety of conditions to work properly. This is an important limitation, given the many challenges involved in the construction of a suitable image database. In this context, this study investigates how the size and variety of the datasets impact the effectiveness of deep learning techniques applied to plant pathology. This investigation was based on an image database containing 12 plant species, each presenting very different characteristics in terms of number of samples, number of diseases and variety of conditions. Experimental results indicate that while the technical constraints linked to automatic plant disease classification have been largely overcome, the use of limited image datasets for training brings many undesirable consequences that still prevent the effective dissemination of this type of technology.",

        "abstract": "Bibiographic data such as collections of scientific articles and citation networks have been studied extensively in information visualization and visual analytics research. Powerful systems have been built to support various types of bibliographic analysis, but they require some training and cannot be used to disseminate the insights gained. In contrast, we focused on developing a more accessible visual analytics system, called SurVis, that is ready to disseminate a carefully surveyed literature collection. The authors of a survey may use our Web-based system to structure and analyze their literature database. Later, readers of the survey can obtain an overview, quickly retrieve specific publications, and reproduce or extend the original bibliographic analysis. Our system employs a set of selectors that enable users to filter and browse the literature collection as well as to control interactive visualizations. The versatile selector concept includes selectors for textual search, filtering by keywords and meta-information, selection and clustering of similar publications, and following citation links. Agreement to the selector is represented by word-sized sparkline visualizations seamlessly integrated into the user interface. Based on an analysis of the analytical reasoning process, we derived requirements for the system. We developed the system in a formative way involving other researchers writing literature surveys. A questionnaire study with 14 visual analytics experts confirms that SurVis meets the initially formulated requirements.",

        "abstract": "Sorting machines use computer vision (CV) to separate food items based on various attributes. For instance, sorting based on size and colour are commonly used in commercial machines. However, detecting external defects using CV remains an open problem. This paper presents an experimental contribution to external defect detection using deep learning. An uncensored dataset with 43,843 images including external defects was built during this study. The dataset is heavily imbalanced towards the healthy class, and it is available online. Deep residual neural network (ResNet) classifiers were trained that are capable of detecting external defects using feature extraction and fine-tuning. The results show that fine-tuning outperformed feature extraction, revealing the benefit of training additional layers when sufficient data samples are available. The best model was a ResNet50 with all its layers fine-tuned. This model achieved an average precision of 94.6% on the test set. The optimal classifier had a recall of 86.6% while maintaining a precision of 91.7%. The posterior class-conditional distributions of the classifier scores showed that the key to classifier success lies in its almost ideal healthy class distribution. The results also explain why the model does not confuse stems/calyxes with external defects. The best model constitutes a milestone for detecting external defects using CV. Because deep learning does not require feature engineering or prior knowledge about the dataset content, the methodology may also work well with other foods.",

We examine the particular agricultural problems under study, the specific models and frameworks employed, the sources, nature and pre-processing of data used, and the overall performance achieved according to the metrics used at each work under study. Moreover, we study comparisons of deep learning with other existing popular techniques, in respect to differences in classification or regression performance.

        "abstract": "Large amounts of municipal sewage sludge are generated every year. Composting is one of the most popular and cost-effective methods of handling this waste. It is particularly important to carry out the composting of sewage sludge in an efficient way. The identification of the stage of early maturity of composted material is crucial. The objective of this study was to check the possibility of using convolutional neural networks to classify the early maturity of compost made from sewage sludge and rapeseed straw. The literature review showed that this specific and modern type of neural network had not been investigated for this purpose before. A mixture of these two substrates, composted for 25 days in 7 experiments, was the research material. Images of the material samples were acquired in a dedicated photo station illuminated with: visible light, ultraviolet light, and mixed visible and ultraviolet light. For each acquisition variant 1312 images were obtained. On the basis of the acquired images, 25 convolutional neural networks with one convolutional layer and a varied number of convolution filters were developed to determine the stage of early maturity of the material. Their classification error ranged from 0.51% to 17.77%. The best classification result was obtained for the model containing 16 convolution filters and based on images of the material acquired in mixed visible and ultraviolet light. The results presented in this paper have shown that convolutional neural networks are an adequate tool to assess compost maturity. Such models may provide a simplified and cost-effective approach to the approximate evaluation of the early maturity of compost.",

This study presents a novel and accurate method for discriminating healthy date fruit (cv. Shahani), from defective ones. Furthermore, owing to the use of deep CNN, this method is able to predict the ripening stage of the healthy dates. The proposed CNN model was constructed from VGG-16 architecture which was followed by max-pooling, dropout, batch normalization, and dense layers. This model was trained and tested on an image dataset containing four classes, namely Khalal, Rutab, Tamar, and defective date. This dataset was collected by a smartphone under uncontrolled conditions with respect to illumination and camera parameters such as focus and camera stabilization. The CNN model was able to achieve an overall classification accuracy of 96.98%. The experimental results on the suggested model demonstrated that the CNN model outperforms the traditional classification methods that rely on feature engineering for discrimination of date fruit images.",

        "abstract": "In agriculture production, the enormous volume of wastage production is a major concern. Therefore, composting a massive amount of thrash will transform from agricultural wastage to stabilized, disinfected, and pollution-less yields, allowing important nutrients to be retained and the fertility of soil to be enhanced. Carbon to Nitrogen proportion (C:N) or estimating seed germination index (GI) is the most well-known technique for deciding the compost development of agricultural throwaway, they are both tedious and hard to carry out. Thus, various powerful feature extraction calculations were utilized in the literature. These broadly utilized texture feature extraction strategies could obtain only single-level characteristics, however, the Faster R - CNN model can separate multilevel image attributes since it has a bunch of cascaded layers of convolution and activation functions that could make sense of color and texture features of composts at different levels. Thus, Fast Regions with Convolutional Neural Network(R-CNN) was acquainted in order to rapidly evaluate compost maturity by examining pictures of different composting phases.",

        "abstract": "Classification of weeds amongst cash crops is a core procedure in automated weed control. Addressing volunteer potato control in sugar beets, in the EU Smartbot project the aim was to control more than 95% of volunteer potatoes and ensure less than 5% of undesired control of sugar beet plants. A promising way to meet these requirements is deep learning. Training an entire network from scratch, however, requires a large dataset and a substantial amount of time. In this situation, transfer learning can be a promising solution. This study first evaluates a transfer learning procedure with three different implementations of AlexNet and then assesses the performance difference amongst the six network architectures: AlexNet, VGG-19, GoogLeNet, ResNet-50, ResNet-101 and Inception-v3. All nets had been pre-trained on the ImageNet Dataset. These nets were used to classify sugar beet and volunteer potato images taken under ambient varying light conditions in agricultural environments. The highest classification accuracy for different implementations of AlexNet was 98.0%, obtained with an AlexNet architecture modified to generate binary output. Comparing different networks, the highest classification accuracy 98.7%, obtained with VGG-19 modified to generate binary output. Transfer learning proved to be effective and showed robust performance with plant images acquired in different periods of the various years on two types of soils. All scenarios and pre-trained networks were feasible for real-time applications (classification time\u00a0<\u00a00.1\u00a0s). Classification is only one step in weed detection, and a complete pipeline for weed detection may potentially reduce the overall performance.",

Compost maturity is an important criterion for measuring the quality of compost-products. Biochemical tests are conventional methods to evaluate compost maturity, but they are time consuming and difficult to perform. Therefore, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were introduced to realize fast evaluation of compost maturity by analyzing images of different composting stages. Images of 3 different composting materials were collected to build 4 data sets, which included nearly 30,000 images, and a series of experiments were performed on them.
